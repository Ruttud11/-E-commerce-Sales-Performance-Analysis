E-commerce Sales Performance Analysis:

This project performs a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of an e-commerce dataset. The primary goal is to provide key business insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and regional trends to support strategic decision-making.

**Project Overview:**

This project uses SQL to query and analyze data from a relational database schema consisting of five interconnected tables: Customers, Products, Orders, OrderDetails, and Regions. The analysis focuses on extracting critical business metrics and insights that can be used to optimize sales and improve customer management.

**Key Analyses & Insights**

**Sales Performance:** The project calculates Total and Categorised Revenue to understand which products and categories are the most profitable. It also includes an analysis of returned orders to identify revenue loss.

**Customer & Product Analysis:** The analysis identifies top-selling and least-selling products, providing insights for inventory management and marketing strategies. It also pinpoints top-spending customers and analyzes customer acquisition trends to inform customer relationship management (CRM) efforts.

**Regional Performance:** The project evaluates regional sales performance and return rates by region. This allows for a geographic understanding of market strengths and weaknesses, helping to tailor strategies to specific regions.

**Query Optimization:** The project's SQL queries are designed for efficiency, demonstrating an understanding of how to retrieve data quickly and effectively from a large-scale database.

**Technologies Used**

SQL: The core language used for all data querying, analysis, and data manipulation.

MySQL: The relational database management system used to design and execute the database schema and queries.
